# Pong
This is a replication of the videogame Pong, which was released in 1972 by Atari. I used this (and the further games listed) to build my C++ skills, as well as to learn about the SDL library in the context of videogame programming.
To play it (and the rest of the games in this Github), simply download the code as a zip and open the "Pong.exe" file.
